The current state of the app is poor becuse the backend is shitty and i need to imporve a ton of stuff.                         
If you have experiance in making a downloader in python or any other programming language that can be compiled so it can be                 used in python feel free to make a pull request.                                                                                          
                                                                                                                                                  
>What am i going to add to the app ?
1. Detect if the program is already installed
2. Uninstall option
3. Installation progress
4. Image for each program
